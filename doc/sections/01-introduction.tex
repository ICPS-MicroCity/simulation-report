\section{Introduction}

The objective of the simulation is to determine whether a situated recommendation system can positively affect the visitor flow in an amusement park or not. The \textit{amusement park} case study has already been discussed in the \href{https://github.com/ICPS-MicroCity/case-study-analysis/releases/tag/v0.2.1}{case-study-analysis}: this report will use the terms of the \textit{ubiquitous language} identified in the analysis document; please, refer to it to avoid ambiguities.

A simulation is the right way to predetermine how a populated system can work. Specifically, an amusement park populated by visitors moving around can be seen as a complicated system where people direct themselves towards a specific location in order to satisfy their needs. Under this perspective, the \textit{Alchemist Simulator} \cite{Pianini_2013} is perfect to endow simulated people with a personal will to satisfy their needs and direct themselves towards the desired attraction in the amusement park.
