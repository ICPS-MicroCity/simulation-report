\section{Conclusions}
This project was developed for the \textit{Intelligent Cyber-Physical Systems} course.

One possible future development for the project is to switch language for the aggregate programming computations.
In fact, \textit{Alchemist} offers many \textit{incarnations} that allow developers to build complex systems with different syntaxs and paradigms.
For instance, a \textit{work-in-progress} version of the simulation is being developed with the~\href{https://scafi.github.io/}{\texttt{scafi}} incarnation.
In fact, \texttt{scafi} is a \textit{Domain Specific Language} for aggregate computing built on top of \textit{Scala}.
The advantages that it brings are a static type-checking system that makes it easier to develop complex simulations.
Moreover, it allows performing aggregate and local computations, that belong to different paradigms, with the same language and data structures.
